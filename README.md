# Description

This application links an LLM to gmail apis functions to see what behaviors it could do. My google oauth client isn't verified so logging in may seem suspicious...

Here's a link to its deployment:
([ai-email-helper](https://ai-email-helper.nathannguyen951.workers.dev/))

Instructions:
1. Log in with google + allow gmail permissions
2. Enter in a prompt (e.g. "Trash a spam email?" or "Can you get my last email received?")
3. Press "Submit Prompt" button
4. Wait for response in the "output" section
